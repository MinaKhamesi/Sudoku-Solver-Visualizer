###### Three algorithms used in this application are:
 * backtracking
 * best-first search
 * Algorithm X implemented with dancing links.

## Algorithm X by Dancing Links

I learnt the algorithm X during this project, since I found the learning resources for self taught enthuthiasts hard to find, I thought I share my experience.

The "go to" resource for learning about Dancing Links is "Dancing Link" article by Donald E. Knuth.

But after tons of research and reading through different resources, I found these two articles most helpful. After spending days on underestanding the algorithm X, dansing links and exact cover problem, I finally had my first 'eureka' moment after reading these articles:

After underestanding algorithm X and dancing links, I still felt I need more insight on how to define a sudoku problem as an exact cover problem and how to structure the matrix(aka nodes in the doubly linked list). The following resource hepled me in this phase:
